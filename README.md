# QtPy-ESP32-S2-Backpack-Charger-PCB

This is a PCB design for a backpack charger for the ESP32-S2. It is designed to be used with the [Adafruit ESP32-S2 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4870) and the [Adafruit FeatherWing OLED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4650).

The PCB is based off of the lion battery charger backpack for the ESP32 Feather by [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-s2-esp32-s2/overview).

The backpack charger is designed to be used with a 3.7V 350mAh LiPo battery. The battery can be charged using a USB-C cable. The backpack charger has a USB-C port for charging the battery and a JST PH 2-pin connector for connecting the battery to the ESP32-S2.
